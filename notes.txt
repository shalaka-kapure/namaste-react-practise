npm init -y- to intialise npm in our project. package.json are installed
npm install -D parcel- to install parcel for dev dependency.
npx parcel index.html - to execute
dev build is done, parcel cache is installed.
npm install react- installs react, import react and react dom from React, type=module in <script>
package-lock- locks the version of react used. 
^ caret ~ tilde automatically update the latest version 


Parcel is a bundler.
creates a server
Hot Module Replacement (HMR)- updating the web page as soon as we save the code. It is done by parcel
File watcher algorithm does HMR written in C++
Bundling
minified 
removes all console logs/ cleaning our code
super fast build algorithm
dev and production build
Image optimization (not coming from backend)
caching while development 
compression of files
compatible with older versions of browsers (polyfils converts newer versions of code into older version for the browsers to understand)
enables HTTPS on dev machine (npx parcel index.html --https)
manages Port number
put parcel-cache, dist, node-modules in gitignore 
consistent hashing algorithm to cache and bundling
zero config bundler
Code splitting
Tree shaking- removing unwanted code

Q. why is react fast-- (1)react dom (2)bundlers 

Q. transitive dependencies-- package manager has dependency that are dependend on other dependencies (dependency tree)

Q. Advantages of using JSX: 
(1) readability
(2) developer's experience 
(3) syntactical sugar
